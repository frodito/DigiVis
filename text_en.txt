During the 20th century, Jean Piaget was in the forefront of the development of
constructivism and the struggle to overcome conventional ideas about the acquisition of

epistemological questions: ”What is knowledge? How does one come to know? Can
knowledge be certain?” They arrived at their answers using a logic they considered to be
universal and independent of human subjects. Piaget broke with this tradition by raising a
question which appeared to be simpler and more pragmatic: “How does a child manage to
acquire what goes by the name of knowledge?”.
