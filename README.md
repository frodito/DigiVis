# DigiVis

In this repository you can find the code developed for the project Digitization and Visualization of Archives and Collections, short DigiVis.

The project builds on new possibilities of the development of generic interfaces and the visual exploration of archives and collections and combines them with regard to a modular set of open source software for visual presentation and examination of archival documents. The development and application of the concepts, methods and tools takes place prototypically on the example of the radical constructivism and the Ernst von Glasersfeld Archive, on the other hand, the modular tool set can generally be used in memory institutions in the cultural field (GLAM).

The project was started and carried out by the Department of Media, Society and Communication from the University of Innsbruck.
More detailed descriptions about the project can be found at the webpage for the department [here](https://www.uibk.ac.at/medien-kommunikation/forschung/projekte/index.html.en) and on the webpage of the project [here](https://dbis-digivis.uibk.ac.at/mediawiki/index.php/Project_Digivis).

## Basic Setting 
[MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) and the MW-extensions [Semantic MediaWiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki) and [Semantic Text Annotator](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Text_Annotator) were used as a basis.
Using this setup, selected texts from the [estate of Ernst von Glasersfeld](https://www.evg-archive.net) were collected and saved as pages in [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki).
Discourse analysis was applied on the selected texts and the corresponding sentences and paragraphs were annotated with the help of [Semantic Text Annotator](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Text_Annotator).
Annotated were argumentations, references, narrativs, and innovation discourses, and within argumentations, premises, examples, and conclusions were annotated.
Additionally, argumentations and innovation discourses were linked with the predominant topics found in the corpus.
